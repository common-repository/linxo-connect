== Description ==

The Linxo Connect Payments module allows you to add a **simplified bank transfer payment** option to your WooCommerce online store.


This payment method enables you to:

 * Accept all types of amounts, including large sums.
 * Reduce transaction fees (especially on high-value orders).
 * Avoid impacting the payer's card limit.
 * Offer a bank transfer without the payer needing to enter their IBAN (as everything is pre-filled, minimizing the risk of entry errors).
 * Collect payments instantly (and receive funds within 10 seconds).
 * Benefit from one of the most secure payment methods on the market.


For the payer, the process is very simple. After validating their cart and choosing the Linxo Connect secure bank transfer payment option:

 * A list of banks is displayed.
 * The payer selects their bank and chooses to continue the process on mobile or computer.
 * They are automatically redirected to their bank's website (or app).
 * They authenticate with their bank as usual (face ID, touch ID, username/password, etc.).
 * A summary of the transaction is displayed, and they confirm the payment.
All information (IBAN, label, amount) is pre-filled, minimizing the risk of entry errors.
